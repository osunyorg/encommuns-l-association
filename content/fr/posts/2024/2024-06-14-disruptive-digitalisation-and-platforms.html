    <p>  <br>This book provides an overview of the opportunities and risks of  <br>digitalisation and platforms that embody it and constitute society's <br> new infrastructure. From a management point of view – defined here as  <br>the steering of organised and finalised collective action –  <br>understanding this major socio-technical disruption is paramount. The  <br>book helps to comprehend its main players, such as the American GAFAM,  <br>their power and its sources, their architecture, and their impact on  <br>different industries and professions, labour markets, companies, and  <br>education. Responding to the dominance of tech giants, numerous initiatives are  <br>striving to regulate their influence, safeguard democratic sovereignty,  <br>promote fair competition in the digital sphere, and employ frugal  <br>digitalisation methods to counteract detrimental aspects of these  <br>“oligopolistic” platforms. In essence, shouldn't the overarching aim of  <br>digitalisation be to foster community development, strengthen individual <br> and collective capabilities, and preserve the environment, while  <br>producing goods and services to meet shared societal interests?  <br>Throughout the four sections of this book and its 16 chapters, actors in <br> the digital process and/or academics provide analyses and illustrations <br> of the great digital transformation, examining the ways in which  <br>socio-technical advances can be created or used for the benefit of all,  <br>while avoiding major risks.</p>

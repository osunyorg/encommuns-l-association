        <p>This book provides an overview of the opportunities and risks of  digitalisation and platforms that embody it and constitute society's  new infrastructure. From a management point of view – defined here as  the steering of organised and finalised collective action –  understanding this major socio-technical disruption is paramount. The  book helps to comprehend its main players, such as the American GAFAM,  their power and its sources, their architecture, and their impact on  different industries and professions, labour markets, companies, and  education.</p><p>Responding to the dominance of tech giants, numerous initiatives are  striving to regulate their influence, safeguard democratic sovereignty,  promote fair competition in the digital sphere, and employ frugal  digitalisation methods to counteract detrimental aspects of these  “oligopolistic” platforms. In essence, shouldn't the overarching aim of  digitalisation be to foster community development, strengthen individual  and collective capabilities, and preserve the environment, while  producing goods and services to meet shared societal interests?  Throughout the four sections of this book and its 16 chapters, actors in  the digital process and/or academics provide analyses and illustrations  of the great digital transformation, examining the ways in which  socio-technical advances can be created or used for the benefit of all,  while avoiding major risks.</p>
